            <h2>Statement of Faith</h2>
            
            <p>At Blue Tide Chapel, we stand firmly on the foundation of the Holy Scriptures as the inspired and authoritative Word of God and the teachings of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>We affirm the core truths of the Christian faith as expressed in the Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed, which articulates our belief in the Trinity of God as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</p>
            <p>These essential beliefs shape our understanding of salvation, the Church, and the kingdom of God, guiding us in worship, service, and daily living out our faith. We seek to glorify God through Christ-centered worship, faithful discipleship, and compassionate service to others.</p>

            <p><strong>The Bible</strong> We believe the Bible, composed of the Old and New Testaments, is the inspired, and authoritative Word of God. It is infallible in matters of doctrine and morality. The Bible was conveyed through human authors under divine guidance and serves as our ultimate guide for faith and practice.</p>
            <p><strong>The Holy Trinity</strong> We believe in one God, eternally existing in three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Each person of the Trinity is fully God, sharing the same essence and working together in creation, redemption, and sanctification.</p>
            <p><strong>Jesus Christ</strong> We believe in the deity of our Lord Jesus Christ, His virgin birth, His sinless life, His miracles, His sacrificial death on the cross for our sins, His bodily resurrection, His ascension to the right hand of the Father, and His future return in power and glory.</p>
            <p><strong>Salvation</strong> We believe that salvation is by grace through faith in Jesus Christ alone. It is a gift of God, not earned by works, but freely given to all who repent and believe in Him. Through Christ's death and resurrection, we are reconciled to God, forgiven of our sins, and granted eternal life.</p>
            <p><strong>The Holy Spirit</strong> We believe in the present work of the Holy Spirit, who dwells in every believer, empowering us for godly living, spiritual growth, and service. The Holy Spirit convicts the world of sin, righteousness, and judgment and leads believers into all truth.</p>
            <p><strong>The Church</strong> We believe the Church is the body of Christ, composed of all believers, called to worship, fellowship, discipleship, and the proclamation of the Gospel. The local church is a vital expression of the universal Church, where believers gather for teaching, prayer, and community.</p>
            <p><strong>The Sacraments</strong> We believe in the practice of two ordinances established by Jesus Christ: Baptism and the Lord's Supper. Baptism is the public declaration of faith, symbolizing the believer's identification with Christ's death, burial, and resurrection. The Lord's Supper is a commemoration of Christ's sacrifice, celebrated in unity with fellow believers.</p>
            <p><strong>The Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed</strong> We affirm and uphold the faith expressed in the Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed of 381 AD, recognizing its declaration of the triune God, the full divinity of Jesus Christ, the work of the Holy Spirit, and the unity of the one, holy, catholic (<i>katholikos</i> or universal), and apostolic Church.</p>
            <p><strong>The Return of Christ</strong> We believe in the imminent and personal return of Jesus Christ. He will return to judge the living and the dead, establish His kingdom, and bring about the fullness of God's redemptive plan.</p>
            <p><strong>The Resurrection and Eternal Life</strong> We believe in the bodily resurrection of all people. Those who are in Christ will experience eternal life in the presence of God, while those who reject Him will face eternal separation.</p>
            <p><strong>Christian Living</strong> We believe that as followers of Christ, our communion is to live lives that reflect His love, holiness, and grace. By the power of the Holy Spirit, we seek to grow in Christlikeness, love one another, and reach out to the world with the Gospel.</p>
